  		 Cura(projects) is a semi-annual exhibition that examines the position of artists who curate originally created by<a class="text__link" href="http://sessa.website/">Sessa Englund</a>. For each exhibition artists are invited to work together to create a collaborative show born out of conversations. There is no traditional curator in the show, instead the artists are free to create what they want within the context of the show and with support from the other collaborating artists. 

  		 <br>
  		 <br>
  		 Each show is also accompanied by an essay on the subject by an invited author. The next participants are then asked to read this text before starting the next iteration of the show. The project is open and can really be molded to fit the need and style of the participating artists. It is a chance to explore less hierarchical approach to how artists relate to each other, curation and their community. 

<br>
    	<br>
  	The title of curator has historically been reserved for those with advanced degrees in their chosen fields. This institutional backing has given weight to their judgements on what is capital-A Art and what is not. Yet the origin of the word curate does not stem from a background of academic selection, but rather from the Latin word cura, meaning to care for. A new generation of artists have started performing the role of curator, caring for the work of their peers and creating new collaborative environments. 
<br>
    	<br>

This show emerged from the reality that artists today use curation not only as a form of organization within their communities, but also as an inseparable part of their artistic practice. This shift can be seen as both a positive thing for artists (claiming greater agency over the dissemination of their work), but also as a reflection of the realities of the contemporary labor marketfixed identities are dead, fluid personal enterprises reign supreme. Is the traditional role of the academic curator necessary, or is a new role emerging from the shifting landscape of artists as organizers? At Cura(projects) we will explore these questions by making visible the new networks that exist between artists, curators, and their collaborators.
